# SlipCounterpoint

Slip is an interactive app prototype that gives you freedom to control complex musical parameters complemented by visual patterns with just mouse clicks.

Each click adds a new melody as well as alters the background shade. Depending on when you click, your counterpoint will sound different, creating unique harmonies that are a complete result of your action.
